# Project 5 - Host Behavior Analysis
This project aims to analyze host behavior in a Property Rental company by exploring various metrics. Using SQL for data analysis, we will examine different factors that distinguish Super Hosts from Other Hosts, identify crucial metrics for becoming a Super Host, analyze reviewer comments, and compare property types. The findings will be presented in an Excel dashboard for reporting purposes.

## Problem Statement

Understanding host behavior is crucial for the success of a Property Rental company. By analyzing metrics like acceptance rate, response rate, and review scores, we can gain insights into what sets Super Hosts apart from Other Hosts. This analysis helps the company identify the key factors that contribute to becoming a Super Host and enables data-driven decision-making for improving host performance.
